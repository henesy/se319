	<h3>Share ID: $ID</h3>
	<!--
	Should display songs in the order they will be played...
	maybe click and drag to re-arrange order of songs?
	maybe make URL something like /list/$ID where $ID is the pid for the playlist

	Add upload button to add songs (figure out how to do in-browser .mp3 playing)

	we'd then update the meta.txt file respectively!
